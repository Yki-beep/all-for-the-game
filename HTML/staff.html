            <h3>David Wymack</h3>
            <p>
            <div>David Vincent Wymack is the Foxes' coach.</div>
            <div>He is a large man, with tribal flame tattoos. He has brown
                eyes, and
                is often wearing a white wife beater and jeans.
            </div>
            <div>
                Wymack puts up a tough act in front of the Foxes, but he genuinely cares about them. He deals with
                their antics using both threats and sarcasm. <br>
                Wymack repeatedly tells his team members to not over-exert themselves on the court, especially if
                they are injured. He would rather lose a game than have a player indisposed for future games.
            </div>

            <div>Coach Wymack founded the Foxes to give people from difficult backgrounds another chance. Contrary
                to popular belief, this isn't a publicity stunt. Wymack is seen as idealistic for this. <br>

                To ensure the safety of his players, he goes beyond what a coach is supposed to do and even houses
                some players temporarily in his or Abby's appartment. He is protective of them and offers to help
                Neil if the cousins and Kevin pose too much of a problem, but mostly keeps out of the team's
                personal affairs.</div>
            </p>


            <h3>Abby Winfield</h3>
            <p>
                Abby Marie Winfield is the Foxes' nurse. She is decisive and has no problem to shut people up or order
                them around. Foxes
                usualy joke about Wymack's and Abby's relationship, but they deny it.
            </p>


            <h3>Betsy Dobson</h3>
            <p>
            <div>Betsy Jo Dobson is the Foxes' psychiatrist. </div>
            <div>Betsy's hair is pale brown and reaches to her chin. She has "a few extra curves" and laugh
                lines on her face. She wears narrow-rimmed glasses.
            </div>
            It is mandatory for the team to see her once a semester, but are free to visit her whenever they feel
            the need. This is included in the Foxes' tuition fees. She allows her patients to call her whatever they
            want, from "Betsy" to "Doc" to "Hey You".
