                    <h2 id="exy">Exy</h2>
                    <p>Exy is a sport played on a soccer-sized court that has walls and ceilings made of plexiglass. It
                        is "an
                        evolved sort of lacrosse [...] with the violence of ice hockey". A team consists of six players,
                        each of
                        which has a racquet with varying depths of netting. To score, the players must shoot the ball at
                        the
                        goal, a rectangle marked on the shorter wall. The goal will light up in red if it has been hit.
                        The
                        objective of the game is to out-score one's opponents.
                        Exy is played in two forty-five minute halves with a fifteen minute halftime break.</p>

                    <p>
                    <div>An Exy court is 60 yards wide x 100 yards long x 10 yards tall (or 55 x 91 x 9 in meters --
                        roughly the
                        size of a soccer field). It is completely enclosed by a half-inch thick plexiglass wall:
                        primarily for
                        rebounds and passing, but also to protect the audience from being struck by the ball. Both Home
                        and Away
                        have doors to allow players on and off that bolt on the outside. These doors must not be open
                        when the
                        ball is in play.</div>
                    <div>The court is divided into fourths by three lines: first-court (near the Home goal), half-court,
                        and
                        far-court (near the Away goal). Penalty shots are taken from marked spots halfway between
                        first-court/far-court and the Home/Away goal.</div>

                    <div>The Exy goals are on either end of the court. The actual goal is a 3 x 7 yard (2.7 x 6.4 meter)
                        section
                        on the wall outlined by a bold line. The goalkeeper's territory is the 3 x 7 area on the ground
                        directly
                        in front of the goal, also marked by a line. Players are not allowed to cross the goal line. The
                        boxed-in area of the goal wall is laden with sensors. When a ball strikes inside the goal the
                        wall will
                        light up red. A ball that hits the goal's border itself does not count. Each goal counts as one
                        point.

                            The striker is offense and plays to score. Strikers start the game on the half-court line.
                            The
                            strikers
                            on the serving team start on the inside; strikers for the defending team are on the outside.

                            The dealer serves and is thereafter the middleman; dealers have the option to specialize as
                            offense
                            or
                            defense and can play as an extra striker or backliner depending on how the game is going.
                            Dealers
                            start
                            on the first/far-court lines.

                            The backliner is defense and protects the goal. Backliners start on the first/far-court

                    <div>Six players per team are allowed on the court at a time. Generally speaking, this allows for
                        two
                        strikers, a
                        dealer, two backliners, and the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is an optional position, however; a
                        manager
                        may
                        sacrifice the goal for an extra player under certain circumstances.</div>

                    <div>The minimum size for an NCAA team is currently nine players. In theory this allows for six

                        players
                        and a sub for each position save goalkeeper. After recent events this rule is under review and
                        posited
                        to

                        One yellow card is a warning. Two result in the player sitting out the remainder of the game. A
                        player who is red-carded is immediately expelled from the ongoing game and must sit out of the
                        next
                        one as well.

                        Exy games for youths and high schoolers require four referees at minimum. From the NCAA level
                        upward six
                        are required, three to either side of the court.

                        <summary>Off-sides is in effect on Exy courts</summary>
                        Meaning: an offense player who does not have possession of the ball, or who is moving to take
                        possession
                        of the ball, must have an opposing defense player between him or herself and the opposing
                        goalkeeper at
                        all times. This prevents strikers from waiting near the goal to score. <br>
                        The penalty for off-sides is loss of possession and a reset to the half-court line.

                        <summary>Body checks</summary>
                        Body checks are allowed against players who have reasonable possession of the ball: that is, who
                        currently have it, who have just relinquished it, or who are within a moment of receiving it.
                        The player
                        who currently has possession of the ball may body-check any other player with no restrictions.
                        <br>
                        A faulty body check results in loss of possession and a reset to the next-closest court line.

                        Any other form of fighting is prohibited and will result in a card. The severity decides whether
                        the
                        card is yellow or red; it also determines whether a team deserves a penalty shot or a simple
                        loss in
                        possession. Games are restarted from where play was halted; the exact spot will be decided on by
                        the
                        residing referee. No other player may stand within ten feet of the dealer during a mid-play
                        serve.

                        "Stick checks" are allowed only between racquets. A player who strikes another player's body
                        with his or
                        her racquet will be carded and the opposing team will receive a penalty shot. This includes
                        using one's
                        racquet to trip another player. A stick check against another player's helmet is an immediate
                        red card
                        and earns the wounded team a penalty shot on goal.
