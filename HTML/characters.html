                    <h3>David Wymack</h3>
                    <p>
                    <div>David Vincent Wymack is the Foxes' coach.</div>
                    <div>He is a large man, with tribal flame tattoos. He has brown
                        eyes, and
                        is often wearing a white wife beater and jeans.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Wymack puts up a tough act in front of the Foxes, but he genuinely cares about them. He deals
                        with
                        their antics using both threats and sarcasm. <br>
                        Wymack repeatedly tells his team members to not over-exert themselves on the court, especially
                        if
                        they are injured. He would rather lose a game than have a player indisposed for future games.
                    </div>

                    <div>Coach Wymack founded the Foxes to give people from difficult backgrounds another chance.
                        Contrary
                        to popular belief, this isn't a publicity stunt. Wymack is seen as idealistic for this. <br>

                        To ensure the safety of his players, he goes beyond what a coach is supposed to do and even
                        houses
                        some players temporarily in his or Abby's appartment. He is protective of them and offers to
                        help
                        Neil if the cousins and Kevin pose too much of a problem, but mostly keeps out of the team's
                        personal affairs.</div>
                    </p>


                    <h3>Abby Winfield</h3>
                    <p>
                        Abby Marie Winfield is the Foxes' nurse. She is decisive and has no problem to shut people up or
                        order
                        them around. Foxes
                        usualy joke about Wymack's and Abby's relationship, but they deny it.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Betsy Dobson</h3>
                    <p>
                    <div>Betsy Jo Dobson is the Foxes' psychiatrist. </div>
                    <div>Betsy's hair is pale brown and reaches to her chin. She has "a few extra curves" and laugh
                        lines on her face. She wears narrow-rimmed glasses.
                    </div>
                    It is mandatory for the team to see her once a semester, but are free to visit her whenever they
                    feel
                    the need. This is included in the Foxes' tuition fees. She allows her patients to call her whatever
                    they
                    want, from "Betsy" to "Doc" to "Hey You".

                            University.
                            She
                            is passionate about the Foxes and doesn't tolerate her teammates dragging them down by
                            talking bad
                            about
                            the team.</div>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Appearance</h4>
                            Her brown hair is cut “mercilessly short” in response to “nagging from the men” in her
                            freshman year. She has brown eyes. Her smile was once described as “a toothy grin that
                            was equal parts menace and mirth.” She is about 5'4"-5'7"/162-170cm tall.

                        <div>

                            Dan is passionate and adamant in enforcing the rules she sets. She wants the team to
                            function (or
                            at least not to kill one another) and fully acts her role as captain with conviction. She
                            tries to
                            include everyone in activities. <br>
                            Just like the other members Dan loves to participate in the bets. <br>
                            Dan majored in Athletic Training with a minor in Coaching

                            Dan worked as a stripper in high school as a way of funding her home life. Her stage name
                            was
                            Hennessey, named for the hard liquor. Her fellow strippers became what she considered to be
                            her
                            family, and she refers to them as her "sisters". To work there, Dan had a fake ID stating
                            she was
                            over eighteen. <br>
                            She lived in a mobile home with her aunt, whom she calls by her first name, Cathy, and her
                            children.
                            Cathy had many "suitors", so when Dan first meets Coach Wymack, she first assumes he was
                            looking for
                            relations with her mother <br>
                            Before Wymack came, Dan had no hope for playing Exy at university because she had been told
                            that
                            women weren't recruited. Wymack saw her play by chance; Renee's adoptive mother (a
                            journalist)
                            invited him to watch one of Renee's games. Dan was playing on the opposition's team. <br>
                            Dan was signed to the Foxes in their second year and immediately became team captain.
                            Because she
                            was the first female captain in NCAA Class I Exy in history and because fans already
                            disliked the
                            Foxes, the public was cruel to her and even her teammates shredded her in public. She (and
                            Wymack)
                            persevered and slowly her team fell in behind her.

                        <p>
                        <div>Kevin Day is the starting striker of the Palmetto State Foxes. He was formerly a member of
                            the
                            Edgar
                            Allan Ravens and was considered one of the best contemporary Exy players alongside his
                            adoptive
                            brother
                            Riko Moriyama until an injury to his dominant hand forced to relearn to play with his right
                            hand.
                            <br>
                            Along with Riko, Kevin is often called "The Son of Exy" and "The Future of Exy,"
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Appearance</h4>
                            Kevin has green eyes and dark hair, and is about 6' to 6'2.
                            Kevin has a tattoo on his left cheekbone.

                            <div>Kevin was describes as arrogant, spineless, and Exy-obsessed. Because of his traumatic
                                upbringing,
                                Kevin most likely suffers from anxiety and PTSD. He's also made fun for being a 'healthy
                                nut'
                                when
                                actually this can also be a result from his time with the Ravens and it's most likely an
                                eating
                                disorder.</div>
                            <div>Because of Tetsuji and Riko, Kevin grew up with the mentality that Exy is the most
                                important
                                thing someone can have, which causes him to be merciless when it comes to the game. He
                                has
                                really high standards when it comes to Exy players and is not afraid to point other
                                people
                                faults. This, at times, causes people to get angry and snap at him.</div>
                            <div>Even though hess shown as someone cold and egoistic, he has his own ways of caring for

                            His mother would bring Kevin by the Nest whenever her job brought her to the States
                            (implying that
                            up until her death, it is not unlikely that he grew up in Ireland/Europe). <br>
                            Kevin seems to prefer reading or watching Exy games at his desk to playing video games with
                            his
                            roommates. <br>
                            Kevin hates sitting in the back of Andrew's car, so he mostly rides shotgun. <br>
                            Kevin is not a morning person. It is very difficult to wake him up if he is still tired,
                            which is
                            why Wymack keeps him moving to stop him from falling asleep again.<br>
                            He knows how to manipulate people.<br>
                            Kevin is majoring in history. When he first got to Palmetto he used to talk about it a lot
                            until the
                            other foxes told him to shut up. With time he just stopped altogether.<br>
                            He loves to take photographs. In his dorm at the Nest he had a wall of pictures that he had
                            taken
                            during his travels with Riko.<br>

                            Andrew Joseph Minyard is a sophomore Criminal Justice major at Palmetto State University,
                            and a
                            goalie for the PSU Foxes Exy team. He is known for his ferocity both on and off the court.

                        <div>
                            <h4>Appearance</h4>
                            Andrew has blonde hair, pale skin and hazel eyes. He always wears black wristbands that
                            reach from
                            his wrists to his elbows. They are rumored to be a sarcastic attempt to differentiate him
                            from his
                            twin, Aaron, for other people's sake. In reality, he is hiding the scars on his wrists from
                            years of
                            self-harm, and a convenient sheath for knives. At 5' flat, he is very short - his Exy
                            racquet is
                            taller than he is - and "doesn't look like much" in person, however, he is also considered a
                            person
                            to be afraid of by the majority of The Foxes.

                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                            Andrew keeps his promises, almost to a fault. He will go very far out of his way to protect
                            what's
                            his. His moods generally range from apathy to violence, exceptions that allow differences in
                            his
                            attitude include Renee, Aaron, Kevin, Nicky, and Neil. His cold and heartless exterior is to
                            hide
                            his trauma and insecurities. He is dedicated to upholding a strict set of personal values
                            and is
                            wholly protective of the the people he cares for. Despite these sentiments, he outwardly
                            appears to
                            have little to no regard for his own life.

                            The roof is a favorite hangout of Andrew's; he is afraid of heights (and of falling, as he
                            says) and
                            being on the roof makes him feel alive. <br>
                            Andrew smokes, mostly out the window of his dorm room or on the roof. <br>
                            Andrew always carries knives hidden under his wristbands. He got them from Renee and
                            promised to
                            keep them for her. <br>
                            When Andrew wakes up through someone touching him, his first reflexive reaction is to punch
                            them
                            very hard. He doesn't seem to know this and is surprised when other people are hurt after
                            they wake
                            him. <br>
                            Andrew has an expensive black Maserati. Only a small number of other people are allowed to
                            drive his
                            car, namely Nicky, Renee, and Neil. Andrew's style of driving can be described as reckless.
                            <br>
                            Andrew dislikes visiting the library. According to Nicky, he claims to be allergic to books.
                            <br>
                            Andrew is known to be a really good goalkeeper, but mostly can't be bothered with making an
                            effort
                            to live up to his potential. <br>
                            He says he doesn't hate Exy because he doesn't care about it enough. He only puts up with it
                            because
                            it is less boring than "living". To him, Exy is pointless and could therefore never be fun.
                            <br>
                            He is really good at picking locks and breaks into Neil's room more than once. <br>
                            Andrew doesn't like surprises. <br>
                            He has an eidetic memory. <br>

                            he just wants to be normal (whatever that is). Or special, perhaps, but in the positive ways
                            of
                            being special: intelligent, good-looking, and appreciated. He doesn't want to be associated
                            with
                            those he perceives to be losers, but the universe has conspired against him. He wasn't born
                            into a
                            normal family, and things haven't improved much since then. <br>
                            Aaron is not particularly friendly with any of the other foxes, except his roommate and
                            cousin
                            Nicky. The two sometimes can be seen playing video games together.

                            Nicky is generally cheerful and happy. He is easily upset by the tragedies that many of his
                            teammates experience during the series. He attempts to get along with everyone, though he
                            sticks
                            with Andrew's lot during most of the series. He is closest with Aaron.
                            It is noted by Neil that Nicky's personality is probably more reserved than he typically
                            shows, but
                            that he portrays himself as loud, optimistic, and extroverted as a way to compensate for how
                            closed
                            off the twins are.

                            Renee has a calm disposition, and is the only one of the Foxes who can't be angered by
                            Kevin's blunt
                            criticism.

                            Renee doesn't get involved in other people's fights in any way, but she occasionally
                            mediates
                            between her teammates. Otherwise, she gives friendly advice and is seen as a stabilizing
                            factor for
                            Andrew, along with the rest of the team.

                            The story is that Renee and Dan were captains of two very competitive teams in high school
                            when
                            Wymack was at their match, he liked what he saw and signed them both the same day. Both
                            girls didn't
                            like each other, but had to join fronts with Allison against the sexist boys on the original
                            team to
                            earn their place. <br>

                            Neil Abram Josten or Nathaniel Abram Wesninski(birth name) is a striker for the Palmetto
                            State
                            Foxes, tho he can also play defense, since it was the first role he ever played.
                        <div>
                            <h4>Appearance</h4>
                            Neil is described as a short(5'3"/160 cm) and athletic young adult. When he just joined
                            Foxes Neil
                            dyes his hair
                            black and wears brown contact lenses. His hair is naturally auburn and his true eye color is
                            a
                            chilly shade of blue. He is also attractive, as seen with comments from Nicky and getting
                            hit on by
                            Marissa.
                            His wardrobe consists mainly of worn, basic pieces of clothing, such as t-shirts, jeans, and
                            sneakers. He does not have a particular fashion sense, valuing utility over anything else,
                            and
                            chooses his attire based on its ability to cover his scars and make him appear average.

                            <h4>Personality</h4>
                            Neil is perceptive, a trait necessary for his life on the run. When Andrew picks him up from
                            the
                            airport under the guise of being Aaron, Neil quickly figures out that he isn't actually
                            Aaron, and
                            that he's off his prescribed drugs. <br>
                            Neil doesn't trust other people. He doesn't accept their offers of help and tries to solve
                            every
                            problem on his own, and he is generally closed off and secretive about himself. Neil also
                            attempts
                            to constantly stay in control of the situation. <br>
                            Neil is almost as obsessed with Exy as Kevin is, although he had to stay away from it most
                            of his
                            life. This obsession makes him risk everything to play for the Foxes. <br>
                            He doesn't shy away from a fight. He is good at starting fights but not at winning them.
                            <br>
                            Neil has a
                            certain control over his emotions and can shove down his anger when it interferes with his
                            survival.

                            Neil has a key to the Foxes' stadium. <br>
                            Neil likes running and is the fastest player in Class I Exy, clocking in a mile at four
                            minutes.
                            <br>
                            He is good at picking locks. He inherited his lock picks from his mother. <br>
                            Neil speaks French and German. <br>
                            Neil doesn't take drugs or drink alcohol for fear that he might reveal something about
                            himself when
                            he is intoxicated. As a result, he has a very low tolerance for them. <br>
                            He knows Matt's cell phone number by heart. <br>
                            Once Neil hitch-hiked from New Mexico to Phoenix with various truckers. He pretended to be a
                            sociology major conducting a survey. <br>
                            Neil doesn't like sweets and prefers fruit over vegetables because of what was available
                            during his
                            time on the road. <br>
                            After Andrew's car was destroyed, Neil used the majority of the money his mother had stolen
                            to buy
                            Andrew a Maserati. <br>
                            Neil is of partial Polish descent from his father. <br>
                            Neil smokes sometimes, but he more frequently lights a cigarette and lets it burn on its
                            own. The
                            smell of smoke reminds him of his mother, which is at once comforting and painful. <br>
                            Because of the extensive scars on his torso, Neil will not change or shower in front of
                            other
                            people. To put on his Exy gear, he goes into a toilet stall. <br>
                            Neil and Kevin train every weekday except for Friday, from ten to whenever Kevin sees fit
                            (often
                            midnight or later). <br>
